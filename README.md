# HackLab
A set of network tools for your hacking delight. 

Often when you're connected to a server, you don't necessarily have the right tools at hand. Experienced system administrators often removes packages like `netcat` - and you can forget all about `Wireshark`. Luckily we often find the `Python` package to be installed on such servers, though, and that's where these tools come in handy - a replacement for typical needed network tools.

### Host Scanner
Scan a network for hosts.

First you'd have to figure the local IP of the device you're connected to - something like `ip addr` for Linux, or `ip config` for Windows. Then edit the script (line 11 & 12) with that IP (host) and define what subnet to search (subnet) - ex, .0/24 for the whole subnet.

Run it with root privileges;

    $ sudo python3 hostScanner.py

After just a few seconds you'll begin to get devices that responded to a UDP broadcast.

```
Host Found: 100.103.175.246
Host Found: 100.103.175.253
Host Found: 100.103.175.243
Host Found: 100.103.175.249
```

### Netcap Replacement
Netcat (NC) is a popular network tool, which in some cases might be completly removed from remote servers. In that case might come in handy to have some simple NC functionality, such as pushing files, executing commands or initializing a shell. 

Run it with `-h` to get a full set of option and examples;

```
Netcat Replacement Tool

Use with: netcatRepl.py -t target_host -p target_port
-l --listen listen on [host]:[port] for incomming connections
-e --execute=file_to_run to execute a given file on receiving a connection
-c --command initialize a command shell
-u --upload=destination to upload a file on receiving a connection


Examples: 
netcatRepl.py -t 192.168.0.1 -p 5555 -l -c
netcatRepl.py -t 192.168.0.1 -p 5555 -l -u=c:\target.exe
netcatRepl.py -t 192.168.0.1 -p 5555 -l -e="cat /etc/passwd"
echo 'Hello World' | ./netcatRepl.py -t 192.168.0.1 -p 5555
```

You can test it locally by first firing up a listener;

    $ ./netcatRepl.py -l -p 9999 -c
    
The `-c` will initialize a command shell for the client machine. Then fire up a second replacement tool, without the listener;

    $ ./netcatRepl.py -t localhost -p 9999
    
On your client, hit `CTRL-D` to interact with the "server" which initializes the command shell;

```

### SSH Command
Fire off a quick command against a SSH host, that you already have the right credentials. 

This requires you to have the `Paramiko` package installed - do so with your package-manager (preferred) or with `pip` ex.

    $ sudo pacman -S python3-paramiko

First define your SSH Host, Credentials and Command at the last line in this script. My test server is called `serv` and I'll be running the command `id` - Change the IP accordingly;

```
sshCommand('192.168.0.1','serv','PASSWORD','id');
```

Then run it through your glorious system;

```
$ ./sshCommand.py 
uid=1000(serv) gid=1000(serv) groups=1000(serv),10(wheel)
```

<br><br>
### SSH Reverse
Windows doesn't come with SSH out the box, but we'd often like out communication encryption anyways. We can do this by reversing the communication, such as we'll be sending commands from our SSH server to a simple SSH client we set up on the Windows machine. 

We'll be using `sshServer.py` and `sshReverseCmd.py` for this magic. 

This requires you to have the `Paramiko` package installed - do so with your package-manager (preferred) or with `pip` ex.

    $ sudo pacman -S python3-paramiko
    
Note that you'll have to pass along a SSH-Key in the server file. You could use this [Paramiko test key](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/master/demos/test_rsa.key) if you feel lazy.

There's no example for this one (didn't want to be bothered firing up a Windows machine), but the idea is that you fire up a cmd window (on your Windows system), run the server file and point it to your own SSH server - Change the IP and Port accordingly;

    $ sshServer.py 192.168.0.1 22
    
Now edit the `sshReverseCmd.py` (last line) with the Credentials for your own SSH server, and run it - This will be acting as our client; 

    $ sshReverseCmd.py

<br><br>
### TCP Client and Server
A simple example of a TCP client/server communication. This could'nt be more fitting, since we've have just been working with socket programming in my CS class. 

Define the IP and Port in the `tcpServer.py` on line 5 & 6 - By default it will bind to all devices (0.0.0.0) and listen on port 9999.


Now, edit the `tcpClient.py` on line 4 & 5 to target the listening server and port. Also edit your request on line 12. This can be done in a test our test-environment;

Now fire up the server and your client (make the request);

```
$ ./tcpServer.py 
[*] Listening on 0.0.0.0:9999
Connection accepted from: 127.0.0.1:49854
[*] Received: Hello World
```

```
$ ./tcpClient.py
ACK!
```

The server only responds with `ACK!`, but you can easily expand this simple concept with your own returns.

<br><br>
### TCP Proxy
Read trafic data to get a better understanding of the applications using the protocol with the `tcpProxy.py`. A nice little test would be to point it at a ftp server. We'll test it on our localhost along with a FTP server that makes sense to you - Port 21 is priviledges, so run it with `sudo`;

```
$ sudo ./tcpProxy.py localhost 21 ftp.SERVER.com 21 True
[*] Listening on localhost:21
```

Now fire up your FTP application and point it to `localhost` at port `21` and connect.

```

### UDP Client
Just as our TCP client, the UDP client isn't much different. Define a target IP and Port at line 4 & 5. The UDP client will fire off a message defined at line 9 and wait for the reponse.
